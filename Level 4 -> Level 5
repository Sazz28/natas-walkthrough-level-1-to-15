b.	Check common files if any!! But nothing found. 
c.	Then I decide to use burp and intercept request 
 
d.	Nothing looks fishy. But one thinks clicks in my minds was the index.php page with

e.	So, I try to add referrer header using burp because only authorized users should come only form {http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/}
f.	And BOOM!! Access granted!! Also the flag.

FLAG: - (Access granted. The password for natas5 is 0n35PkggAPm2zbEpOU802c0x0Msn1ToK)
