a.	After reading the whole source code through view source code. The thing I understand was:
  i.	The background color and the inclusion of the password are both stored in the same array
  ii.	The loadData() function takes the cookie value, decodes it, and then uses it to set web page values (the background color and whether we see the password)
  iii.	If there is a “data” array from the browser cookie, the value is base64 decoded, then XOR encrypted (since XOR is reversible with the same mathematical function, this is equivalent to XOR decoding),
        then JSON decoding.

b.	Let’s begin:
  i.	Cookie from the Dev Tool with the name of data is:

    HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg%3D

  ii.	%3D is URL-encoded =, so first we normalize it:

    HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg=

  iii.	We know that this cookie includes showpassword=no and we want to change it to showpassword=yes.
  iv.	We’ll need to XOR decrypt it, but there’s a problem: we don’t have the key.
  v.	Remember that our cookie value was generated by: setcookie("data", base64_encode(xor_encrypt(json_encode($d)))); We don’t have ability to XOR encrypt yet, but we can take steps to get there.
  vi.	First, let’s use a PHP compiler to make a cookie without XOR encryption, using just array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff");
 
	Get the XOR key:
I.	We have encrypted cookie, which is: 

eyJzaG93cGFzc3dvcmQiOiJubyIsImJnY29sb3IiOiIjZmZmZmZmIn0=

II.	our challenge is that we can XOR the two cookies together to get the XOR key, then use this to create a new cookie and encrypt it.

Use CyberChef or a similar tool to XOR
HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg= with eyJzaG93cGFzc3dvcmQiOiJubyIsImJnY29sb3IiOiIjZmZmZmZmIn0=
	 
 	This gives us an XOR key of {eDWo} (repeating).
Making a new cookie
# Now that we have the key, let’s make a JSON object of {"showpassword":"yes","bgcolor":"#ffffff"}, then XOR encrypt it, and then base64-encode it.
 
i.	This gives us a cookie value of HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUc9MhxHaHUNAic4Awo2dVVHZzEJAyIxCUc5
ii.  Open up Dev Tools on the Natas level 11 page, and change the cookie value to ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMOXTlTWxooFhRXJh4FGnBTVF4sFxFeLFMK.
Refresh the page, and you should see the level 12 password:
